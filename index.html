      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Chinmay, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer based in Austin, Texas, with extensive experience in developing cutting-edge AI algorithms. After earning my PhD, where I focused on adaptive activation functions across various machine learning models, I chose to work in a consultancy-based company to gain exposure to building practical AI applications. In this role, Iâ€™ve contributed to a diverse set of projects across multiple domains, including AI for rail car safety, road safety, medical imaging, vision-language models, and large language models for repair instructions. Currently, I am exploring the exciting 3D space with vision-language models.
      </p>
      <p>
        While deeply involved in these real-world applications, I have continued to engage in research work in areas such as radiology, pathology, and drug discovery, and have published several papers in these fields. This blend of applied work and research underscores my commitment to both advancing AI technology in industry and pushing the boundaries of knowledge through academic exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical expertise, my roles as a GTM, technical architect, and technical program manager have allowed me to hone my leadership, project management, and team collaboration skills. I have successfully managed multiple projects, delivering results on time and ensuring customer satisfaction, all while fostering effective communication between technical teams and clients.

    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I cherish spending time with my loving family. My wife, Stacy, a compassionate therapist, and I share a beautiful blend of Western and Indian cultural backgrounds, which enriches our lives with diverse perspectives and traditions. We have recently welcomed our newborn, who brings immense joy to our lives. Our family is also completed by our adorable dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring new outdoor activities like playing soccer and volleyball, and I also have a deep passion for motorcycle riding â€” a love that probably started from weaving through the chaotic streets of India on a two-wheeler. I appreciate engaging in fun projects that combine my passion for AI with everyday life, such as developing AI-based semantic search tools using baby books and creating AI home security systems. Additionally, I cherish spending quality time with my family, whether it's going for walks with my wife and our dog, or now, with the added joy of our newborn, creating new memories together.
