      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Chinmay, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer based in Austin, Texas, with extensive experience in developing cutting-edge AI algorithms. After earning my PhD, where I focused on adaptive activation functions across various machine learning models, I chose to work in a consultancy-based company to gain exposure to building practical AI applications. In this role, Iâ€™ve contributed to a diverse set of projects across multiple domains, including AI for rail car safety, road safety, medical imaging, vision-language models, and large language models for repair instructions. Currently, I am exploring the exciting 3D space with vision-language models.
      </p>
      <p>
        While deeply involved in these real-world applications, I have continued to engage in research work in areas such as radiology, pathology, and drug discovery, and have published several papers in these fields. This blend of applied work and research underscores my commitment to both advancing AI technology in industry and pushing the boundaries of knowledge through academic exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical expertise, my roles as a GTM, technical architect, and technical program manager have allowed me to hone my leadership, project management, and team collaboration skills. I have successfully managed multiple projects, delivering results on time and ensuring customer satisfaction, all while fostering effective communication between technical teams and clients.
